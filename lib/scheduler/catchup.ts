 * last ~60 seconds, so a longer full outage silently drops them.
 *
 * Order matters when upgrading a deployment from before coalescing existed:
 * schedules are re-asserted first so every fire carries its singleton key,
 * the queue policy is flipped to 'stately' only after that (keyless fires
 * under stately would collide queue-wide), and catch-up jobs are sent last
 * so the policy dedupes them against queued fires and against other
 * replicas reconciling concurrently.
 *
 * Failures are isolated per task — one bad row must not block other tasks'
 * recovery or stop the worker from consuming.
